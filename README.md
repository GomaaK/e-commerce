# e-commerce
The idea is to take readers through the day to day activity of a developer takeling various levels of problems.

I will use [trello](https://trello.com/b/QCZMwrnv/e-commerce) to plan my work. It can also give an insight in how to plan and decompose a project.

# More about the project

The project will feature:
- **Basic** product landing page that is features the hottest product.
- Product listing with caching
- Product advanced search
- Orders submissions and payments
- Orders tracking

# Disclamer

By creating this I don't claim:
- This is the best way to implement such project
- This is the best process to follow in development
- This is the ideal technologies to use for each component created

This is only my way of answering my students recurring questions while giving them a taste of how I would approach things.
